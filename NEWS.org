#+TITLE: mu4e-views Updates

This file provides an overview of what is new in each =mu4e-views= version. Since I only started keeping track after version 0.5, this is incomplete.

* Version =0.6= (development version)
- supports mu version 1.5.x and 1.6.x
- new view methods:
  - view emails in browser with filtering
  - view email as pdf (relies on external tool such as =html-pdf=)
- one-time switching of viewing method to temporarily view the current message using a different view method without changing the viewing method (the next email to be opened will be shown using the standard viewing method selected by the user)
-  dispatcher view method allows to let =mu4e-views= select an appropriate view method for each email based on a set of rules, e.g., show non-html emails using the build-in mu4e view method or filter out remote content for all emails except for senders from a whitelist.
* Version =0.5=
- make logging toggable
- support older mu4e versions
* Version =0.1= to =0.4=
